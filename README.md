# Enigma
This project was a basic java recreation of the German Enigma machine used to create encoded messages as well as to decrypt them with the same settings.

After compiling, the string imput format for a message is as follows:

{Rotor Numbers} {Rotor Letters} {10 or less Plugboard Pairs} : {Message}

Example:

I III II A B C HN LK TH DO : HELLOWORLD
